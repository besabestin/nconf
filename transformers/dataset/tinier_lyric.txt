chorus
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in 
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me ?And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared ?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I'm turning to a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest Do I have to run and hide ? I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made it's home inside
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me ?And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared ?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I'm turning to a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger (x2) All through the day I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
All through the night I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
Now they're frightened of leaving it,
Everyone's weaving it,
Going on strong all the time,
All through the day I me mine.
I me me mine,
I me me mine,
I me me mine,
I me me mine.
All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
No-one's frightened of playing it,
Everyone's saying it,
Flowing more freely than wine,
All through the day I me mine.
I me me mine,
I me me mine,
I me me mine,
I me me mine.
All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
No-one's frightened of playing it,
Everyone's saying it,
Flowing more freely than wine,
All through your life I me mine. If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead,
If the rain comes, if the rain comes
When the sun shines they slip into the shade,
And sip their lemonade,
When the sun shines, when the sun shines
Rain, I don't mind,
Shine, the weather's fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
Everything's the same,
I can show you, I can show you.
Can you hear me that when it rains and shines,
It's just a state of mind,
Can you hear me, can you hear me ? Warriors
As a child, you would wait
And watch from far away.
But you always knew that you'll be
The one that work while they all play.
And you, you lay, awake at night and scheme
Of all the things you that would change, But it was just a dream !
Here we are, don't turn away now,We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now,We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the best, improve yourself,Your spirit never dies !
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,Don't weep for me'Cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now,We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now,We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
Here we are, don't turn away now,We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now,We are the warriors that built this town
From dust. Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book ?

Paperback writer I’m waking up to ash and dust

Come together Under the arc of the weather stain boards
Ancient goblins, and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the nights come and the cold wind blows
No one cares and nobody knows
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again
I'll follow Victor to a sacred place
There ain't no dream I can escape
Molars and fangs and clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
When the night has come and the moon is bright
Someone cries and something ain't right
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again
Oh no
The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And on the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again
Oh no Ich brauche Zeit, kein Heroin,
Kein Alkohol, kein Nikotin
Keine Hilfe, kein Koffein
Nur Dynamit und Terpentin
Ich brauche Öl für Gasolin
Explosiv wie Kerosin
Mit viel Oktan und frei von Blei
Einen Kraftstoff wie Benziiiiiin !
Benziiiiiin ! (x3)
Brauch keinen Freund, kein Kokain
Brauch weder Arzt noch Medizin
Keine Frau, nur Vaseline
Etwas Nitroglyzerin
Brauche Geld für Gasolin
Explosiv wie Kerosin
Mit viel Oktan, frei von Blei
Einen Kraftstoff, wie Benziiiiin !
Benziiiiiin ! (x3)
Es fließt durch meine Venen
Es schläft in meinen Tränen
Es läuft mir aus den Ohren,
Herz und Nieren sind Motoren
Ja !
Benzin !
Willst du dich von etwas trennen,
Dann musst du es verbrennen,
Willst du es nie wiedersehen,
Lass es schwimmen in Benzin
Benziiiiiin ! (x3)
Ich brauch Benzin
Gib mir Benzin
Ich trink Benzin Manches sollte, manches nicht
Wir sehen, doch sind wir blind
Wir werfen Schatten ohne Licht
Nach uns wird es vorher geben
Aus der Jugend wird schon Not
Wir sterben weiter, bis wir leben
Sterben lebend in den Tod
Dem Ende treiben wir entgegen
Keine Rast, nur vorwärts streben
Am Ufer winkt Unendlichkeit
Gefangen so im Fluss der Zeit
Bitte bleib steh'n, bleib steh'n
Zeit
Das soll immer so weitergeh'n
Warmer Körper ist bald kalt
Zukunft kann man nicht beschwör'n
Duldet keinen Aufenthalt
Erschaffen und sogleich zerstör'n
Ich liege hier in deinen Armen
Ach, könnt es doch für immer sein!
Doch die Zeit kennt kein Erbarmen
Schon ist der Moment vorbei
Zeit
Bitte bleib steh'n, bleib steh'n
Zeit
Das soll immer so weitergeh'n
Zeit
Es ist so schön, so schön
Ein jeder kennt
Den perfekten Moment
Zeit
Bitte bleib steh'n, bleib steh'n
Wenn unsre Zeit gekommen ist, dann ist es Zeit zu geh'n
Aufhör'n, wenn's am schönsten ist, die Uhren bleiben steh'n
So perfekt ist der Moment, doch weiter läuft die Zeit
Augenblick, verweile doch, ich bin noch nicht bereit
Zeit
Bitte bleib steh'n, bleib steh'n
Zeit
Das soll immer so weitergeh'n
Zeit
Es ist so schön, so schön
Ein jeder kennt
Den perfekten Moment If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down. )
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down. )
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down. )
Everything's the same.
(When the sun shines down. )
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down. )
It's just a state of mind ?
(When the sun shines down. )
Can you hear me, can you hear me ?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads. Ah, look at all the lonely people (x2)
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
(Chorus)
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?
Father Mc
Kenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
(Chorus)
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people (x2)
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father Mc
Kenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
(Chorus)
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? (Chorus : Imagine Dragons)
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
(Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign)
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us ?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
(Chorus : Imagine Dragons)
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
(Verse 2: Logic)
I been at it with my homies
It don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause you know what?
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bustin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up
(Chorus : Imagine Dragons)
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
Cause i'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
(Chorus : Imagine Dragons)
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
(Outro : X Ambassadors)
More pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For More Pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging.... Wilder Wein 
Wilder Wein - vor deinem Schloss*
Wilder Wein - ich bin bereit
Man meldet Ankunft - nur für den König
Gott steh mir bei - und öffne deine Tore
Wilder Wein - und ganz langsam
Wilder Wein - so warm und feucht
Wilder Wein - vor deinem Schoss
Wilder Wein - es steht geschrieben
Tief im Wasser - kreuzt man nicht
Doch meine Lust - verlacht die Flügel
Wilder Wein - wie eine Taube
Wilder Wein - so nass und heiß
Wilder Wein - vor diesem Dunkel
Wilder Wein - von Licht geheilt
Es bleibt verborgen - sonst könnten wir uns wehren
Ich warte auf dich - am Ende der Nacht
Wilder Wein - nur eine Traube
Wilder Wein - und bitter wie Schnee
Ich warte auf dich - am Ende der Nacht Demons 
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale
I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
At the curtain’s call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made
Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Kingdom come Crests Of Waves 
It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no
I could be lost
Or I Could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again
Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh
Screaming out from the crests of waves
It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Like a light lit upon a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve, oh
You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in
Ohhh, Ohhh
Ohhh, Ohhh
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where your longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where your longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing Gold 
Fast comes the blessing of all that you dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can’t tell the false from the real
Who can you trust?Who can you trust?
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold...
Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have’s turnin’ stale and it’s cold
Oh, you no longer fear when your heart’s turned to gold
Who can you trust?Who can you trust?
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold...
I’m dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing, nothing, nothing,Nothing
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold... Animals we are
Disposable, collapsable and raw,
In you go into some crowded room
And animals that climb
And they're climbing over you until you say
Off you go, off you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Animal I am
And I'm looking for an answer just like you
But I should know which way to turn
An animal that runs,
And I ran away from you because I'm scared
Off you go, off you go
If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now
Oh, oh
Animal you are
Disposable, defenceless yes and...
Watch your mouth, boys watch your mouth
I'm an animal that runs,
And I made all my excuses to you
And I missed my chance by a stones throw
If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now
Go now
Go now
Go now
One
Now crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal
I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal
Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal
Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal Help !
Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, Help !
When I was younger, so much you younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and I opened up the doors.
Hep me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me  !
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
When I was younger, so much you younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and I opened up the doors. Schöner, größer, härter
Straffer, glatter, stärker
Deine Brüste sind zu klein
Zwei Pfund Silikon sind fein
Säcke schneiden von den Augen
Nase fräsen, Fett wegsaugen
Wir entfernen rasch zwei Rippen
Schlauchboot basteln aus den Lippen
In die Wangen, in die Stirn
Botox rein bis ins Gehirn
Zick Zack, Zick Zack, schneid es ab
Zick Zack, Zick Zack, kurz und knapp
Alles Schlaffe überm Kinn
Kann man in den Nacken ziehen
Implantate ins Gefräß
Und wir liften das Gesäß
Messer, Tupfer, Vollnarkose
Sieben Kilo Reiterhose und
Bauchfett in die Biotonne
Der Penis sieht jetzt wieder Sonne
Zick Zack, Zick Zack, schneid das ab
Tick Tack, Tick Tack, du wirst alt
Deine Zeit läuft langsam ab
Wer schön sein will, der muss auch leiden
Aus- und weg- und abschneiden
Nadel, Faden, Schere, Licht
Doch ohne Schmerzen geht es nicht
Wangen straffen, Jochbein schnitzen
Sondermüll in Lippen spritzen
Falten rascheln am Skalpell
Vorhaut weg, sehr aktuell
Ist die Frau im Mann nicht froh ?
Alles ganz weg, sowieso
Zick Zack, Zick Zack, schneid das ab
Tick Tack, Tick Tack, du bist alt
Deine Zeit läuft langsam ab
Wer schön sein will, der muss auch leiden
Eitelkeit ist nie bescheiden
Nadel, Faden, Schere, Licht
Doch ohne Schmerzen geht es nicht
Schöner, größer, härter
Straffer, glatter, stärker It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight
It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright... Woah
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
Never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away (fire!)Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away
Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?I know every single face 'round here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
Never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away (fire!)Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away
Checking the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the rifle's sight
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?I know every single face 'round here
Here in the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
Never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away (fire!)Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away

Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away (fire!)Ready Aim Fire! Ready Aim Fire away Das Schicksal hat mich angelacht
Und mir ein Geschenk gemacht
Warf mich auf einen warmen Stern
Der Haut so nah dem Auge fern
Ich nehm mein Schicksal in die Hand
Mein Verlangen ist bemannt
Wo das süße Wasser stirbt
Weil es sich im Salz verdirbt
Trag ich den kleinen Prinz im Sinn
Ein König ohne Königin
Wenn sich an mir ein Weib verirrt
Dann ist die helle Welt verwirrt
Mann gegen Mann
Meine Haut gehört den Herren
Mann gegen Mann
Gleich und Gleich gesellt sich gern
Mann gegen Mann
Ich bin der Diener zweier Herren
Mann gegen Mann
Gleich und Gleich gesellt sich gern
Ich bin die Ecke aller Räume
Ich bin der Schatten aller Bäume
In meiner Kette fehlt kein Glied
Wenn die Lust von hinten zieht
Mein Geschlecht schimpft mich Verräter
Ich bin der Alptraum aller Väter
Mann gegen Mann
Meine Haut gehört den Herren
Mann gegen Mann
Gleich und Gleich gesellt sich gern
Mann gegen Mann
Doch friert mein Herz an manchen Tagen
Mann gegen Mann
Kalte Zungen die da schlagen
Schwulah
Mich interessiert kein Gleichgewicht
Mir scheint die Sonne ins Gesicht
Doch friert mein Herz an manchen Tagen
Kalte Zungen die da schlagen
Schwulah
Mann gaygen Mann (x3) I’m waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and sweat my rust
I’m breathing in the chemicals
I’m breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it the apocalypse
I’m waking up
I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age

I raise my flag and don my clothes
It’s a revolution I suppose
We’re painted red to fit right in
I’m breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus

I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow

If you love somebody
Better tell them why they’re here ’cause
They may just run away from you
You’ll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I’ve had the highest mountains
I’ve had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not 'til you prove it
Now take it in but don’t look down
‘Cause I’m on top of the world, ‘ay

Been holding it in for a while, ‘ay
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

I’ve tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

Now take it in but don’t look down

I'm on top of the world. Shots
I’m sorry for everything
Oh everything I’ve done
I am out of touch
I am out of my place when I keep saying That I'm looking for an empty space
Oh I'm wishing you're here But I’m wishing you're gone
I can’t have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh I'm going to mess this up Oh this is just my luck over and over and over again
I’m sorry for everything Oh everything I’ve done From the second that I was born It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I love
Do I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved?
I am out of luck I am waiting to break
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh I m wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh I'm going to mess this up Oh this is just my luck over and over and over again
I’m sorry for everything Oh everything I’ve done From the second that I was born It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I love
Do I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved?
In the meantime can we let it go at the road side that we used to know
We can let this drift away
We let this drift away at the bayside where you used to show in the moon light
Where we let it go we can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away and there’s always time to change your mind
Oh there’s always time to change your mind
Oh love can you hear me Oh let it drift away
I’m sorry for everything Oh everything I’ve done From the second that I was born It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot shot shot a hole through everything I love
Do I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved? Wenn die Kinder unerzogen
Schon der Vater hat gedroht
Der schwarze Mann, er wird dich holen
Wenn du nicht folgst meinem Gebot
Und das glauben wir bis heute
So in Angst sind Land und Leute
Etwas Schlimmes wird geschehen
Das Böse kommt, wird nicht mehr gehen
Und die Furcht wächst in die Nacht
Tür und Tore sind bewacht
Die Rücken nass, die Hände klamm
Alle haben Angst vorm schwarzen Mann
In Dunkelheit schleicht er heran
Bist du nicht brav, fasst er dich an
Traue keinem Fremden dann
So viel Albtraum, so viel Wahn
Und das glauben wir bis heute
Schwer bewaffnet ist die Meute
Ach, sie können es nicht lassen
Schreien Feuer in die Gassen
Und die Furcht wächst in die Nacht
Gar kein Auge zugemacht
Die Rücken nass, die Hände klamm
Alle haben Angst vorm schwarzen Mann
Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann ?
Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann ?
Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann ?
Wer hat Angst ?
Und die Furcht wächst in die Nacht
Gar kein Auge zugemacht
Die Rücken nass, die Hände klamm
Alle haben Angst
Schwarzer Mann
Schwarzer Mann Little fifteen,
You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet.
And if you could drive,
You could drive her away
To a happier place,
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile.
She could escape there
Just for a while.
Little fifteen.
Little fifteen,
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth ?
It's already more than enough.
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And it's little intrigues.
Do you understand ?
Do you know what she means ?
As time goes by,
And when you've seen what she's seen.
You will,
Little fifteen.
Little fifteen,
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is three little wishes :
She wants to see with your eyes,
She wants to smile with your smile,
She wants a nice surprise,
Every once in a while.
She wants to see with your eyes,
She wants to smile with your smile,
She wants a nice surprise,
Every once in a while.
Little fifteen Tiptoe 
In the morning light let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don’t see me come, who can blame them?Never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why
I won’t fall asleep
I won’t fall asleep
Higher, don’t let ‘em know we’re coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher
From your slender dream see the morning dream
Sink into the soul, watch the water go
They won’t feel it like, who can blame them?They never know if they see me fly, so I never have to run
I won’t fall asleep
I won’t fall asleep
Higher, don’t let ‘em know we’re coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher
Nobody else, nobody else
Nobody else, you take me higher 
Higher, don’t let ‘em know we’re coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher
Higher, don’t let ‘em know we’re coming
Higher, tiptoe higher
Take some time to sip it down, keep your head down low
Higher, tiptoe higher That boy took my love away
Oh, he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy, this boy Never Let Me Down Again 
I'm taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he's taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride
With my best friend
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground
I'm taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm safe as houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground
Never let me down
See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight [First Verse]
Come waste your millions here
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow (x2)
[Chorus]
She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons make no mistakes
[Second Verse]
Come let the truth be shared
No-one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries
[Chorus]
[Third Verse] (x2)
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever
I can't face the shame I've read you well
I just wan't to get away
Cos' you used my love
I just need to get away
My trust in you has been abused
My trust in you has been overused
Sick of this space
Wish we could be far away
Cos' I wasted all my youth
I'll never see it again
My trust in you has been abused
My trust in you has been overused
I will welcome you to everything
Because you've bled me dry
Now I just wanna run away
I just wanted too much
I wish we could be far away
And if my wish comes true
You'll never see me again As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly
Death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see
Hey you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving
There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do its educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you
Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching
Can you feel a little love ?
Can you feel a little love ?
Dream on dream on
Blame it on your karmic curse
Oh shame upon the universe
It knows its lines
It's well rehearsed
It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving
Can you feel a little love ?
Can you feel a little love ?
Dream on dream on Ich leb' alleine schon viele Jahre
Das Leben stumpf, der Alltag grau
Verlier' Geduld, Verstand und Haare
Ich hätte gerne eine Frau
Und die Hoffnung will mir schwinden
Eine Partnerin zu finden
Die mir ebenbürtig ist
Nein, da ist kein Glück in Sicht
Sie muss nicht schön sein
Sie muss nicht klug sein, nein
Sie muss nicht reich sein
Kein Modell mit langen Schritten
Doch dicken Tittеn
Wie eine stеtig offene Wunde
Aus der Seele tropft das Blut
Einzig Trost sind kleine Hunde
Ein feines Fräulein wäre gut
Ein feines Fräulein wäre toll
Ich bin auch gar nicht anspruchsvoll
Ich bin auch gar nicht wählerisch
Am Ende der Geschicht
Muss sie nicht schön sein
Sie muss nicht klug sein, nein
Sie muss nicht reich sein
Doch um eines möchte ich bitten
Dicke Titten
Ich bin auch gar nicht anspruchsvoll
Doch große Brüste wären toll
Sie muss nicht schön sein
Sie muss nicht klug sein
Sie muss nur reich sein
An Fettgewebe, bitte, bitte
Sie wird nichts bei mir vermissen
Sie braucht mich auch gar nicht küssen
Braucht mich nicht mit Trauben laben
Sie muss nur Riesentitten haben
Dicke Titten Confide in me
Sustain on my apathy
You're such a mess
You can try not to confess
[Chorus]
You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake up and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again
We'll fall asleep
So deeply out of reach
For years feeling dead
We can't fall right out of bed
[Chorus]
Hey ! Such a mess
But I don't care
Simply because I can't
Wake up and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again Oh
Ooh, yeah
I just pretend
That I'm in the dark, and
I don't regret'Cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
I never lied
When I cried for you
And I know you cry too(Know you cry too)You're reading minds
Just couldn't deny you do
Always hard to say bye to you(And I taught myself to say)
Love the way you're talkin'Love your style, but, ooh, babe
We know that you got it from me
And it's haunting you deep
Too hard not to see it
Hate the way I feel love
Only hurts with real love
And it's taking every part of me
When you look, I could see love
One day, I'm giving you space
And the next day, you're giving me faces
And I like parties, not this place
It's comin' out of my bag for you to get wasted
I (Can't stop staring at you)It's like I forgot that staring is rude
And that's what five shots could turn me into (Oh yeah)But you've done most things that gentlemens do, so (Oh)
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes (Your eyes)I see there's something burning inside you (Inside you)Oh, inside you (Oh, inside you)In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to (Try to)Oh, you try to (I try to, babe)
You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)You always know just what to say (Oh yeah)I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you (Hey)Oh, define you She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time so
Look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you've never shown her
Too little much too late
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world
[Chorus]
Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own
I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world
[Chorus] There's so much on my mind
I don't know where to start
There's that light in your eye filling up the dark
Though, I lost myself
I know it's not the end
You're my shooting star
You make my heart ascend
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
I know that we're far from where we need to be
But the world wasn't made in just one day
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong
You're my shooting star
We're flying high above
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith
And I don't know where to turn
To bend my mind as the silver gate
You lead me on my way
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just levitate, just levitate Smoke and Mirror
This is my word
This is my way
Show me a sign
Sweep me away
This is my word
Heartbreaker
Gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away
I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart
Deep in my mind
Take me away
Take me away
This is my word
Dream maker
Life taker
All I believe
Is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me ?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors ?
(I want to believe)
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors ?
All that I've known
Buildings of stone
Fall to the ground
Without a sound
This is my word
Heartbreaker
Gatekeeper
I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave
I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth
But I wanted the pain
To disappear
Dream maker
Life taker
Open up my mind
All I believe
Is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me ?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors ?
(I want to believe)
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
Believe
I want to believe
All I believe
Is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me ?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors ?
(I want to believe)
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors ? Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Stars are only visible in the darkness,Fear is ever-changing and evolving And I, I can poison the eyes
And I, I feel so alive
Nobody can save you now
The king is crowned
It's do or die!Nobody can save you now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry!Nobody can save you now
IT'S DO OR DIE
Nobody can save you now
The king is crowned
It's do or die!Nobody can save you now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry!Nobody can save you now
IT'S DO OR DIE
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
And all this time I've been afraid wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now I’m coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
I’m the colorless sunrise
That’s never good enough
I’m the wind that’s in your head
It ruffles you up
You could find the reason
You could let me know
I won’t blame you
I'll just turn and go
I’m coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
Coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I’m coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
Searching to find myself
And all I find is you
I could hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?You could find a reason
You could let me know
I won’t blame you
I just didn’t go
I’m coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
Coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I’m coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
No matter, no matter
No matter what we’re facing
It don’t matter, it don’t matter‘Cause the reason that I’m here
Is the same through all these years
Not changing, not changing anything at all
I’m coming home to you (I’m coming home)Every night every night every night every night
Coming home to you (I’m coming home)Every night every night every night every night
My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I’m coming home to you (I’m coming home)Every night every night every night every night [First Verse]
We said our goodbyes,
Ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes,
Ah, the night before.
Now today I find
You have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did
The night before.
[Second Verse ]
Were you telling lies,
Ah, the night before ?
Was I so unwise,
Ah, the night before ?
When I held you near
You were so sincere.
Treat me like you did
The night before.
[Chorus]
Last night is a night
I will remember you by.
When I think
Of things we did it
Makes me wanna cry.
[First Verse]
When I held you near
You were so sincere.
Treat me like you did
The night before.
[Chorus]
[Second Verse ]
Like the night before. I Was Me
It's just another day
It's just another year
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am
If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I was me
I'll try hard to make this ride
I'll try hard to win this fight
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am
If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I was me
Give me strength to fight
Help me feel alive again
Make me whole inside
Instead, this hole inside is killing me
Oh, I'm begging you
If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I was me I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah

Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, INo competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars Two, three

Babababababaaa Sah ein Mädchen ein Röslein stehen
Blühte dort in lichten Höhen
Sprach sie ihren Liebsten an
Ob er es ihr steigen kann
Sie will es und so ist es fein
So war es und so wird es immer sein
Sie will es und so ist es Brauch
Was sie will bekommt sie auch
Tiefe Brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares Wasser will
Rosenrot oh Rosenrot
Tiefe Wasser sind nicht still
Der Jüngling steigt den Berg mit Qual
Die Aussicht ist ihm sehr egal
Hat das Röslein nur im Sinn
Bringt es seiner Liebsten hin
Sie will es und so ist es fein
So war es und so wird es immer sein
Sie will es und so ist es Brauch
Was sie will bekommt sie auch
Tiefe Brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares Wasser will
Rosenrot oh Rosenrot
Tiefe Wasser sind nicht still
Tiefe Brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares Wasser will
Rosenrot oh Rosenrot
Tiefe Wasser sind nicht still
An seinen Stiefeln bricht ein Stein
Will nicht mehr am Felsen sein
Und ein Schrei tut jedem kund
Beide fallen in den Grund
Sie will es und so ist es fein
So war es und so wird es immer sein
Sie will es und so ist es Brauch
Was sie will bekommt sie auch
Tiefe Brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares Wasser will
Rosenrot oh Rosenrot
Tiefe Wasser sind nicht still
Tiefe Brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares Wasser will
Rosenrot oh Rosenrot
Tiefe Wasser sind nicht still Nur der Tod währt alle Zeit
Er flüstert unterm Tannenzweig
Muss alles in sein Dunkel ziehen
Sogar die Sonne wird verglühen
Doch keine Angst, wir sind bei dir
Ein letztes Mal, so singen wir
Adieu, Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen
Den letzten Weg musst du alleine gehen
Ein letztes Lied, ein letzter Kuss
Kein Wunder wird geschehen
Adieu, Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen
Die Zeit mit dir war schön
Aus dem Leben steigst du leise
Die Seele zieht auf stille Reise
Fleisch vergeht, Geist wird sich heben
Das Sein wird sich dem Tod ergeben
Ja
Am Ende bist du ganz allein
Doch wir werden bei dir sein
Adieu, Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen
Den letzten Weg musst du alleine gehen
Ein letztes Lied, ein letzter Kuss
Kein Wunder wird geschehen
Adieu, Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen
Die Zeit mit dir war schön
Jeder stirbt für sich allein
Ganz allein
Doch du wirst immer bei uns sein
Adieu, Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen
Den letzten Weg musst du alleine gehen
Ein letztes Lied, ein letzter Kuss
Kein Wunder wird geschehen
Adieu, Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen
Die Zeit mit dir war schön Mein Herz Brennt
Nun liebe Kinder gebt fein acht
Ich bin die Stimme aus dem Kissen
Ich hab euch etwas mitgebracht
Hab es aus meiner Brust gerissen
Mit diesem Herz hab ich die Macht
Die Augenlieder zu erpressen
Ich singe bis der Tag erwacht
Ein heller Schein am Firmament
Mein Herz brennt
Sie kommen zu euch in der Nacht
Dämonen Geister schwarze Feen
Sie kriechen aus dem Kellerschacht
Und werden unter euer Bettzeug sehen
Nun liebe Kinder gebt fein acht
Ich bin die Stimme aus dem Kissen
Ich hab euch etwas mitgebracht
Ein heller Schein am Firmament
Mein Herz brennt
Sie kommen zu euch in der Nacht
Und stehlen eure kleinen heissen Tränen
Sie warten bis der Mond erwacht
Und drücken sie in meine kalten Venen
Nun liebe kinder gebt fein acht
Ich bin die Stimme aus dem Kissen
Ich singe bis der Tag erwacht
Ein heller Schein am Firmament
Mein Herz brennt All for You
I get caught in the water
I get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river
While the sun goes down
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
I get tossed by the ocean
Piled deep in the sand
I'm drowned out by the thunder
Lost in a laugh
Is anyone listening ?
Is anyone around to see
That I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind is not ready to go
Ready to go
25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind is not ready to go
Ready to go
I said, 25 seconds, your heart will stop resting !
Your body starts shaking
Your mind is not ready to go
Ready to go [First Verse]
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
I got everything that you want
Like a heart that's oh, so true
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied
[First Verse]
To you I'm So Sorry
'Bout time for anyone telling you wrong for all your deeds
No sign the roarin' thunder stopped and called the lead
No time
Get in line and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone
Love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up
You gotta let go
You'll never be loved
'Till you make your own
You gotta face up
You gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low (too low)
Oh son of a
Stepfather
Oh son of a
I'm so sorry
Oh son of a
Stepfather
Oh son of a
I'm so sorry
No lies and no deceiving, man is what he loves
I keep trying to conceive that death is from above
No time
Get in line and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone
Love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up
You gotta let go
You'll never be loved
'Till you make your own
You gotta face up
You gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low (too low)
Oh son of a
Stepfather
Oh son of a
I'm so sorry
Oh son of a
Stepfather
Oh son of a
I'm so sorry
Life isn't always what you think it be
You turn your head for one second and tables turn
And I know, I know, that I did you wrong
Will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you
Somehow
Somehow
So you gotta fire up
You gotta let go
You'll never be loved
'Till you make your own
You gotta face up
You gotta get yours
You'll never know the top till you get too low (too low)
Oh son of a
Stepfather
Oh son of a
I'm so sorry
Oh son of a
Stepfather
Oh son of a
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Oh son of a So here it gives again
Rape and pillage proves
To win the public vote
Someone tells me who will take the prize
And who takes the fall
[Chorus]
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
Downtown comes again
And how most are shifting like a chameleon
Someone tells me why she breaks my fall
And then breaks my heart
[Chorus]
Wow
[Chorus] Up in the morning,up in the evening,Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.Oh, to me.
Up on the mountain,Down in the king's lair,Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.Oh, afternoon.
We were never welcome here,We were never welcome here at all.Noooooooooooo.
It's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day
Save us,What we are,Don't look clear,It's all uphill from here.Oohhhhhhhhhhh.
Up in the attic,Down in the cellar,Lost in a static,Coming back for more.Oh, for more.
Out with the reason,In with the season,Taking down names in my book of jealousy.Jealousy.
We were never welcome here,We were never welcome here at all.Noooooooooooo.
It's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not okay
Because it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day
Save us,What we are,Don't look clear,It's all uphill from here.Oohhhhhhhhhhh.
They say we're crazy.They say we're crazy.They say we're crazy.They say we're crazy.They say we're crazy.They say we're crazy.THEY SAY WE'RE CRAZY.THEY SAY WE'RE, CRAZY.
It's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not okay
Because it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not okay
Save us,What we are,Don't look clear,It's all uphill from here.Oohhhhhhhhhhh.
(They say we're crazy.They say we're crazy.) The House Of Rising Sun
(Chorus:)There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
Oh, Mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Oh yeah, spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun
(Chorus) I've spent most of my time
With you chasing 'round my vice
You must have known you weren't the only one
So when your lips are telling lies
I can tell when you recite
I can see myself through your eyes
You know what I want, I won't say it
You know what I want, I won't say it, babe
(Chorus:)Because now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(How you feeling?)
Girl, I've learned to use your love
Me and you, we're not the same
You can't use someone who never trusts
Inconspicuous and fame
Me and you, we're not the same
Didn't have to be so obvious
You know what I want, I won't say it
You know what I want, I won't say it, babe
(Chorus:)Because now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(It done sent me out my mind)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
Burning me, child
Well, I'm a sucker for that kind of magic
Fucking like we 'bout to start our own Noah's Ark
Cause even though we was automatic
We never kept a secret in the dark
When you make up your mind
Baby, call me please
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(How you feeling?)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(It done sent me out my mind)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(It done sent me out my mind)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y(Look out for yourself)My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)(Look out for yourself)But I'm ready
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)(Look out for yourself)My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)(Look out for yourself)Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint(Look out for yourself) Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feelin' two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How could I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
(1) feeling two foot small est intraduisible
Feeling small= se sentant rabaissé, humilié
2 foot = 61 centimètres
Donc il sent sa taille rabaissée à 61 centimètres
Et cela explique pourquoi il attire tant l'attention You make it look like it’s magic
Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
Yeah
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night
(So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expected)
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
On that lonely night
You said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it there was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside
Yeah
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it She's gone
2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Get's colder day by day
I miss her
I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time
In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Get's colder day by day, I miss you
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time I Bet My Life
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I've been around the world but never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies
But now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you Leave In Silence
I've told myself so many times before
But this time I think I mean it for sure
We have reached a full stop
Nothing's going to save us from the big drop
Reached our natural conclusion
Outlived the illusion
I hate being in these situations
That call for diplomatic relations
If I only knew the answer
Or I thought we had a chance
Or I could stop this
I would stop this thing
From spreading like a cancer
What can I say
I don't want to play anymore
What can I say
I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence
Leave in silence
We've been running round in circles all year
Doing this and that and getting nowhere
This will be the last time
I think I said that last time
If I only had a potion
Some magical lotion
That could stop this
I would stop this
I would set the wheels in motion
What can I say
I don't want to play anymore
What can I say
I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence
Leave in silence Jimmy Kane can't sleep at night
Sex in pain
Keeps me alive
(Chorus)
You can't confuse yourself
They make you know what else
You can't fake it
You will never make it
You can't confuse yourself
They make you know what else
You can't fake it
You will never make it
Yeah
You're to blame
For everything
Sex in pain
Keeps moving me
Keeps me
(Chorus) Spring/Saute :
Und der Mob fängt an zu toben
Sie wollen seine Innereien und schreien : Spring !
Fragt sich - was hab ich getan
Ich wollte nur zur Aussicht gehen
Doch tausend Sonnen brennen nur für dich
Bref, maintenant : La Morale de l'histoire :
Auf einer Brücke ziemlich hoch
Hält ein Mann die Arme auf
Da steht er nun und zögert noch
Die Menschen strömen gleich zu auf
Auch ich lass mir das nicht entgehen
Das will ich aus der Nähe sehen
Ich stelle mich in die erste Reihe und schreie...
Der Mann will von der Brücke steigen
Die Menschen fangen an zu hassen
Sie bilden einen dichten Reigen
Und wollen ihn nicht nach unten lassen
So steigt er noch mal nach oben
Und der Mob fängt an zu toben
Sie wollen seine Innereien und schreien
Spring
Erlöse mich
Spring
Enttäusch mich nicht
Spring für mich
Spring ins Licht, spring
Jetzt fängt der Mann zu weinen an
(Heimlich schiebt sich eine Wolke)
Fragt sich - was hab ich getan
(vor die Sonne, es wird kalt)
Ich wollte nur zur Aussicht gehen
(die Menschen laufen aus den Reihen)
Und in den Abendhimmel sehen
Und sie schreien
Spring
Sie schreien
Spring
Erlöse mich
Spring
Entäusch mich nicht
Spring für mich
Spring ins Licht, spring
Heimlich schiebt sich eine Wolke
Vor die Sonne, es wird kalt
Doch tausend Sonnen brennen nur für dich
Ich schleich mich heimlich auf die Brücke
Trete ihm von hinten in den Rücken
Erlöse ihn von diesem Schmach und schrei ihm nach
Spring
Erlöse dich
Spring
Enttäusch mich nicht
Spring für mich
Enttäusch mich nicht Tell 'em this boy was made for loving
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothing
It's all I know, never learned much more
Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it ruined me one day, yeah
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
I seemed to push them away
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
I know you don't really understand it
I'm not allowed to regret my choice
I heard that love is risk worth taking
I've learned to know never been that boy
Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it ruined me one day, yeah
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
I seemed to push them away
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
Heaven only lets a few in
It's too late for me to choose it
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong.
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice
Now I'm stepping out tas long. his old brown shoe, baby,
I'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here. ,
It won't be the same now, , I'm telling you.
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby,
I'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here,
It won't be the same now when I'm with you.
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect,
My love is something you can't reject.
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
That love of your, to miss that love is something I'd hate.
I'll make an early start,
I'm making sure that I'm not late.
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue,
Baby, I'm in love with you.
I'm so glad you came here,
It won't be the same now when I'm with you.
I'm so glad you came here,
It won't be the same now when I'm with you. I feel the blood rushing throughout your body
You see the scars painted over my skin
I'm always numb to the topic of loving
I fell in love with the subject of sin
I don't have to remind you
It's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you ?
(Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you
Don't have to remind you
Where you belong ?
I'm in control, when you give me your body, yeah
I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm inside of you and I
I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you, where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want
I don't have to remind you
It's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you ?
(Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you
Don't have to remind you
Where you belong ? I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watch that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit with danger
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
Transition to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Your features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen now show me
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
Your face is hidden and we're out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answer's nowhere
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watch that man to a stranger
Think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit, red danger
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life Your warmth, your warmth,
Is so deep,
Your gaze,
Beams a hole inside me
[Chorus]
Controlling again
Unseparated twins
Controlling again
You've sucks
All the breath out of me
You'll squeeze
All the life out of me
[Chorus]
Controlling again
Unsepareted twins
You'd rather be
Come gentle, slowly,
Gentle We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name (call out my name)Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (want you to stay)I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You're on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to—
So call out my name (call out my name, baby)So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)Just call out my name, and I'll be on my way
Girl, I'll be on my—
On my way, all the way
On my way, all the way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way(On my) You don't realize how much
I need you.
Love you all the time,
Never leave you.
Please come on back to me.
I'm lonely as can be.
I need you.
Said you had a thing or two
To tell me.
How was I to know you would
Upset me.
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes.
You told me.
Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this,
I just can't go on anymore.
Please remember how I feel
About you.
I could never really live
Without you.
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me.
I need you.
But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this,
I just can't go on anymore.
Please remember how I feel
About you.
I could never really live
Without you.
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me.
I need you. (x3) Cast your eye tears on to me
And I'll show you what you really need
Give too much attention
And I'll reflect your imperfections
[Chorus] :
Can't you see it's over
Because you're the god of a shrinking universe
Purposeless survival
Now there's nothing left to die for
So don't struggle to recognize
Now the cruelly heart-felt suicide
[Chorus](x2) My secret garden's not so secret anymore !
Run from the house holding my head in my hands
Feeling dejected,
Feeling like a child might feel
It all seems so absurd
That this should have occurred
My very only secret
And I had to go and leak it !
My secret garden's not so secret anymore !
No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore !
Run through the fields,
Down to the edge of the water
Can't stay long,
Here comes the reason why
She'll catch me if she can,
Take me by the hand
I'll have to keep on running
And I just can't see the fun in
My secret garden not being secret anymore !
It used to be so easy
On days such as these she'd
Search and search for hours
In among the flowers
I loved it ! - I loved her !
Play the fool, act so cruel - I loved it !
Read her book, take a look - I loved her !
It all seems so absurd
That this should have occurred
My very only secret
And I had to go and leak it !
My secret garden's not so secret anymore ! Reise, Reise 
Auf den Wellen wird gefochten
Wo Fisch und Fleisch zur See geflochten
Der eine sticht die Lanz im Heer
Der andere wirft sie in das Meer
A-hoi
Reise Reise, Seemannreise
Jeder tuts auf seine Weise
Der eine stößt den Speer zum Mann
Der andere zum Fischer dann
Reise Reise, Seemannreise
Und die Wellen weinen leise
In ihrem blute steckt ein Speer
Bluten leise in das Meer
Die Lanze muss im Fleisch ertränken
Fisch und Mann zur Tiefe sinken
Wo die schwarze Seele wohnt
Ist kein Licht am Horizont
A-hoi
Reise Reise, Seemannreise
Jeder tuts auf seine Weise
Der eine stößt den Speer zum Mann
Der andere zum Fischer dann
Reise Reise, Seemannreise
Und die Wellen weinen leise
In ihrem blute steckt ein Speer
Bluten leise in das Meer
Reise Reise, Seemannreise
Und die Wellen weinen leise
In ihren herzen steckt ein Speer
Bluten sich am Ufer leer
Bluten sich am Ufer leer I've been a martyr for love
And I will die in the flames
As I draw my last breathe
As I close in on death
I will call out your name
I've been a martyr for love
Nailed up on the cross
While your having your fun
As the damage is done
I'm assessing the cost
I knew what I was letting my self in for
I knew that I could never even the score
I've been a martyr for love
I need to be by your side
I have knelt at your feet
I have felt your deceit
Couldn't leave if I tried
I've been a martyr for love
Tortured every hour
From the day I was born I've been moved like a pawn
By the greatest of powers
I knew that I would have to suffer in vein
Aware that I would never out grow the pain
I've been a martyr for love
I've been a martyr for love
I've been a martyr for love
I've been a martyr for love Too many young and too many old
Too many people left you in the cold
And you want everything to change
Because you are afraid of losing
She only exists when she's on a screen
He's only alive inside a machine
We want everything to change
Because we are afraid of losing
Tell me do you really need this
Tell me do you really care
Tell me do you really need this
Tell me do you really care
'Cause I don't think you really need this
And I don't think you really care
And I don't think you really need this
And I don't think you really care
Too many young and too many old
Too many people left you in the cold
But we want everything to change
Now I'm so afraid of losing
Yeah yeah yeah Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency
And pull us through
And pull us through
(Chorus)
And this is the end
This is the end
Of the world
And it's time we saw a miracle
Come on it's time for something biblical
To pull us through
And pull us through
(Chorus)
Proclaim eternal victory
Come on and change the course of history
And pull us through
And pull us through
(Chorus) Well, you hold the line
When every one of them is giving up or giving in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...
(Chorus:)Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Call out to the beast, not a word without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...
(Chorus)
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
(Chorus)
Natural
Yeah, you're a natural  You know my name

Sense of elation
You'll never dream of breaking this fixation
You will squeeze the life out of me

Non je ne pleurerai pas

Oui j'ai pleuré, mais ce jour-là

Je ne pleurerai pas
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on

Oui j'ai pleuré, mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas People are people
So why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
So we're different colours
And we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you
So what could I have done
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
People are people
So why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
Help me understand
Now you're punching
And you're kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fists
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
People are people
So why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand Ich liebe dich
Ich liebe dich nicht
Ich liebe dich nicht mehr
Ich liebe dich nicht mehr
Ich liebe dich nicht mehr
Oder weniger als du
Als du mich geliebt hast
Als du mich noch geliebt hast
Die schönen Mädchen sind nicht schön
Die warmen Hände sind so kalt
Alle Uhren bleiben stehn'
Lachen ist nicht mehr gesund und bald...
Such ich dich hinter dem Licht
Wo bist du ? Wo bist du ?
So allein will ich nicht sein
Wo bist du ? Wo bist du ?
Die schönen Mädchen sind nicht schön
Die warmen Hände sind so kalt
Alle Uhren bleiben stehn'
Lachen ist nicht mehr gesund und bald...
Ich suche dich hinter dem Licht
Wo bist du ? Wo bist du ?
So allein will ich nicht sein
Wo bist du ? Wo bist du ?
Ich such dich unter jedem Stein
Wo bist du ? Wo bist du ?
Ich schlaf' mit einem Messer ein
Wo bist du ? Wo bist du ? (Verse 1)
Wasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself
(Chorus)
And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
(Verse 2)
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' (winnin')
But you've been with me from the beginnin' (ooh, yeah, yeah)
And I know right now that we're not talkin' (not talkin')
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)
I'll take my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (I'll beat it)
This sex will get you high without no other substance
(Chorus)
So who do you belong to now? (Who do you belong to now?)
Who you give that love to now? (Who you give that love to now?)
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now? (Who you gettin' sprung for now?)
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot (I got a lot)
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot (blowin' up their spot)
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings (feelings)
(Bridge)
Catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee
Feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee
(Outro)
Wake up
I don't wanna wake up

If you ain't layin' next to me
I don't wanna wake up

If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e
On me, me, on me, oh, I
On me, on me, on me Come on now, don't you want to see ?
This thing that's happening to me
Like moses has power over sea
So you've got power over me
Come on now, don't you want to know ?
You're a refuge, somewhere I can go
You're air that, air that I can breathe
Cause you're my golden opportunity
And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I

Come on now, don't you want to see ?
Just what a difference you've made in me

Cause I've been waiting for days, days, days
And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I

Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If it's gonna rain down, it can rain on me
It can rain on me I got a man but, I want you
I got a man but, I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Making me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just want to get with you
(Chorus:)And you're right
You right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know it could be, babe, and you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairytales, but we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Boy, you can take it off of me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to bе
I can't tell no one, but they all know
I got a man but, I want you
I got a man but, I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Making me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just want to get with you
(Chorus)
Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy (Oh, yeah) when you're on top of me (Oh, yeah)
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate (Oh) 'cause you choose loyalty (Oh, yeah)
And I know your history (Hey), met him before your peak (Hey)
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but the sex what clogged your memory
A couple strokes, I'll put it in, then you'll belong to me
(Chorus)
And you're right (Right)
You right, I got my guy (I got my—)
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Said, you right (Yeah), I got my guy (Yeah)
But I (Yeah), I can't help it, I want you  [ refrain ]
It's only when i lose myself in someone else
That i find myself
I find myself
Its' only when i lose myself in someone else
That i find myself
I find myself
Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotized, i feel paralyzed
I have found heaven
There's a thousand reasons
Why i shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here i can think of two
Keep me hanging on
Feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven
[Refrain]
It's only when i lose myself in someone else
That i find myself
I find myself
It's only when i lose myself in someone else
That i find myself
I find myself
I can feel the emptyness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied
I belong inside
You velvet heaven
Did i need to sell my soul
For pleasure like this
Did i have to lose control
To treasure your kiss
Did i need to place my heart
In the palm of your hand
Before i could even start to understand
[Refrain]
It's only when i lose myself in someone else
That i find myself
I find myself
It's only when i lose myself in someone else
That i find myself
I find myself Sehnsucht 
Lass mich deine Träne reiten
Übers Kinn nach Afrika
Wieder in den Schoss der Löwin
Wo ich einst zu Hause war
Zwischen deine langen Beinen
Such den Schnee vom letzten Jahr
Doch es ist kein Schnee mehr da
Lass mich deine Träne reiten
Über Wolken ohne Glück
Der große Vogel schiebt den Kopf
Sanft in sein Versteck zurück
Zwischen deine langen Beinen
Such den Sand vom letzten Jahr
Doch es ist kein Sand mehr da
Sehnsucht versteckt
Sich wie ein Insekt
Im Schlafe merkst du nicht
Dass es dich sticht
Glücklich werd ich nirgendwo
Der Finger rutscht nach Mexiko
Doch er versinkt im Ozean
Sehnsucht ist so grausam
Sehnsucht Well, come on pretty baby, won't you walk with me? Come on, pretty baby, won't you talk with me? Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance Try to save our romance! 
chorus:Slow down, baby, now you're movin' way too fast You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin' Ow! If you want our love to last
Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school Carry your books home, too But now you got a boyfriend down the street Baby what you're tryin' to do? 
chorus
You better slow down! Baby, now you're movin' way too fast You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin' Bbbbb! If you want our love to last 
Well you know that I love you, tell the world I do Come on, pretty baby, why can't you be true? I need your baby, oh so bad little woman I ever h
The best had
chorus, Put on your blindfold
And a dress that's tight
And come with me
On a mystery night
Open your eyes
Follow our stars under a painted sky
We'll leave the world behind
We're learning to fly
We used to get by
Forget the pictures on your TV screen
We'll steal the visions
That you keep for your dreams
You can turn me on
I was blind and I saw the light
My angel coming
In a brilliant white
Shine for me
You've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
Strung up by your insecurities
You can shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
It's difficult not to
Shine for me
Follow our stars under a painted sky
We'll leave the world behind
We're learning to fly
We used to get by
Forget the pictures on your TV screen
We'll steal the visions
That you keep for your dreams
You can turn me on
You've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
Strung up by your insecurities
You can shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
It's difficult not to
Shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
It's difficult not to
Shine for me Wer zu Lebzeit gut auf Erden
Wird nach dem Tod ein Engel werden
Den Blick gen Himmel fragst du dann
Warum man sie nicht sehen kann
Erst wenn die Wolken schlafengehn
Kann man uns am Himmel sehn
Wir haben Angst und sind allein
Gott weiß ich will kein Engel sein
Sie leben hinterm Sonnenschein
Getrennt von uns unendlich weit
Sie müssen sich an Sterne krallen
Damit sie nicht vom Himmel fallen
Erst wenn die Wolken schlafengehn
Kann man uns am Himmel sehn
Wir haben Angst und sind allein
Gott weiß ich will kein Engel sein
Erst wenn die Wolken shlafengen
Kann man uns am Himmel sehn
Wir haben Angst und sind allein
Gott weiß ich will kein Engel sein (Verse 1:)What makes a grown man wanna cry?
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
What makes him wanna take his life?
(Yeah)
His happiness is never real
(Real, real, real, real)
And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he feels
(Chorus:)When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter (it don't matter)
It won't matter (matter)
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (time, it's time, babe)
It won't matter (it won't matter, babe)
It won't matter (ya)
It was like he was never there
(It was like I was never there)
It was like it was gone in thin air, oh
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time, oh baby
It won't matter, it won't matter, baby
(Post-Chorus:)When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
It was like it was gone in thin air,
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter,
(Interlude:)When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter,
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter,
(Bridge:)Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (in my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it
(Outro:)And it's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Woah, woah
Don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Ooh, no Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder
What chance did I have
With the silver moon
Hanging in the sky
Opening old wounds
Taking hold of the hem of your dress
Cleanliness only comes in small doses
Bodily whole but my head's in a mess
Fuelling obsession that borders psychosis
It's a sad disease
Creeping through my mind
Causing disabilities
Of the strangest kind
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt
There's a price that I pay for my mission
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt
How I suffer the sweetest condition
Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder Mother
I've gotta get out of here
So I can save our family
From this poverty
And when I make my money
I'll send it back to you
Father,
Give me strength, I pray
I have to end this misery
It's causing too much pain
I'm gonna look for richer lands
Where the money's made
I'm gonna put my whole world
In your hands
I have to put my whole world
In your hands
In your hands
Mister,
Please let me work somehow
You've kept me waiting eighteen months
And still I'm not allowed
And everytime you promise me :
"Not much longer now "
I've to put my whole world
In your hands
You've got my whole world
In your hands
In your hands
Listen to me, listen to me
Mister,
Mr ! You say you're trying
But don't you know my mother's dying
You say "It won't be long"
But why am I so cursed
For where I am born ?
You've got my whole world
In your hands
I've had to put my whole world
In your hands
I'm gonna put my whole world
In your hands
I've had to put my whole world
In your hands
In your hands Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay,The kiss of death will have to wait
My head, is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it, the mist of darkness
In my head
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound,Oh we, can make it, out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end,As long, as you, are with me, friend
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow'Cause you are all I am
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause I'm addied up added up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in the cup then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Drivin by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in the potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
Cause the shit so strong got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me is when I'm balling with my niggas
Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city to the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't buying
(Chorus:)And she gon give it up cause she know I might like it (x4)
Baby girl you know I like, baby you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like
Don't be mad let her get hers, don't be mad let her get hers
She make her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man your girl so bad let me get her, your girl so bad let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, he can like it or not
Nigga back the fuck up
If you ain't with me motherfucker you against me
If you ain't complimenting, nigga you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time investment
Them fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'm a do it every day in my birthplace
And I ain't been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I'd be sober in the first place
(Chorus)
Baby girl, you know what I love
Baby, you know just what I love
Mmmmmm
I just passed that liquor and falled of the stage
I just sold out the 02 at my own pace
I can say that I'm attached to nobody
I been getting paper while these niggas tryna starve me
Shout my nigga Doc that's a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
Another world I thought we'd back up
Some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they package
New shit, hope it's sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show get her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO, mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch 
When I touch down I'm a change shit up
Fuck a new man, I'm a break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But, that pussy mine for the next three months
'Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen street, nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'm a pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy broke bread on tour, man it's all love now
Shout out my nigga stix, doing good in these streets
Man he popping more bottles then us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through more niggas than apollo
But ain't shit funny, can't nobody stop me
All my hoes trained I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow, all of them swallow I make all of them swallow (x3)
All of, all of, all of them swallow, I make all of them swallow Tier 
Was macht ein Mann
Was macht ein Mann
Der zwischen Mensch und Tier
Nicht unterscheiden kann
Was?
Er wird zu seiner Tochter gehen
Sie ist schön und jung an Jahren
Und dann wird er wie ein Hund
Mit eigen Fleisch und Blut sich paaren
Was tust du
Was fühlst du
Was bist du
Doch nur ein
Tier
Was macht die Frau
Was macht die Frau
Die zwischen Tier und Mann
Nicht unterscheiden kann
Sie taucht die Feder in sein Blut
Schreibt sich selber einen Brief
Entseelte Zeilen an die Kindheit
Als der Vater bei ihr schlief
Was tust du
Was fühlst du
Was bist du
Doch nur ein Tier Bestrafe mich
Bestrafe mich
Stroh wird Gold
Und Gold wird Stein
Deine Grosse macht mich klein
Du darfst mein Bestrafer sein ja
Der Herrgott nimmt
Der Herrgott gibt
Bestrafe mich
Bestrafe mich
Du meinst ja
Und ich denk nein
Schliess mich ein in dein Gebet
Bevor der Wind noch kalter weht
Deine Grosse macht mich klein
Du darfst mein Bestrafer sein
Du darfst mein Bestrafer sein
Deine Grosse macht mich klein
Du darfst mein Bestrafer sein
Deine Grosse macht ihn klein
Du darfst meine Strafe sein
Der Herrgott nimmt
Der Herrgott gibt
Doch gibt er nur dem
Den er auch liebt
Bestrafe mich The loser in the end
Mama's gotta problem, she don't know what to say
Her little baby boy has just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end 
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend (ooh hoo)
She washed and fed, and clothed and cared for nearly twenty years
And all she gets is "Goodbye Ma" and the night times for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend (yeah)
She's ma on whom you can always depend (ooh hoo ooh ooh ooh)
So listen mothers everywhere to just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten all the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember 
It's not so long since you were young
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end 
They'll choose their new shoes, that's not far to bend
You're ma on whom they can always depend (ooh hoo ooh ooh ooh) Stirb Nicht Vor Mir (Don't Die Before I Do) :
 Ich weiß nicht wie du heißt
Doch ich weiß daß es dich gibt
I don't know who he is
In my dreams he does exist
He comes to me every night
Dort liegen sie zu zweit
Und ich
Ich warte nur auf dich
Your love I can't dismiss
Strib Nicht Vor Mir
Die Nacht öffnet ihren Schoß
Das Kind heißt Einsamkeit
Es ist kalt und regungslos
Ich weine leise in die Zeit
Ich weiß nicht wie du heißt
Doch ich weiß daß es dich gibt
Ich weiß daß irgendwann
Irgendwer mich liebt
He comes to me every night
No words are left to say
With his hands around my neck
I close my eyes and pass away
I don't know who he is
In my dreams he does exist
His passion is a kiss
And I cannot resist
Ich warte hier
Don't die before I do
Ich warte hier
Stirb nicht vor mir
I don't know who you are
I know that you exist
Stirb nicht
Sometimes love seems so far
Ich warte hier
Your love I can't dismiss
Ich warte hier
Alle Häuser sind verschneit
Und in den Fenstern Kerzenlicht
Dort liegen sie zu zweit
Und ich
Ich warte nur auf dich
Ich warte hier
Don't die before I do
Ich warte hier
Stirb nicht vor mir
I don't know who you are
I know that you exist
Stirb nicht
Sometimes love seems so far
Ich warte hier
Your love I can't dismiss
Stirb nicht vor mir Baby
It's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now
And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone
Baby
When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now
And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone
On everyone (x3) Links 2 3 4 
Kann man Herzen brechen ?
Können Herzen sprechen ?
Kann man Herzen quälen ?
Kann man Herzen stehlen ?
Sie wollen mein Herz am rechten Fleck
Doch sehe ich dann nach unten weg
Da schlägt es links
Können Herzen singen ?
Kann ein Herz zerspringen ?
Können Herzen rein sein ?
Kann ein Herz aus Stein sein ?
Sie wollen mein Herz am rechten Fleck
Doch seh ich dann nach unten weg
Da schlägt es links 2 3 4
Kann man Herzen fragen ?
Ein Kind darunter tragen* ?
Kann man es verschenken ?
Mit dem Herzen denken ?
Sie wollen mein Herz am rechten Fleck

Links 2 3 4 Like A Hobo
I always know, since i was a young boy
In this world everything is good as bad
Now my father told me always speak a true word
And i have to say that it was the best advice i've had.
Because something burns inside of of me, it's every things i'd long to be
And lies they only stop me from feeling free.
Oh like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Ah ah
I never yearned for anybody's fortune
The less i have the more i am a happy man
And my mother told me always keep your head on
Because some may praise you just to get what they want
And i said mother i am not afraid
They would take what they would take
And what would life be like without a few mistake ?
Oh like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Oh like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Ah ah
Ah ah
Oh like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me
Like a hobo from a broken home
Nothin gonna stop me I'm not going down on my knees
Begging you to adore me
Can't you see it's misery
And torture for me
When I'm misunderstood
Try as hard as you can
I've tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue
In situations like these
Understand me
Understand me
Some people have to be
Permanently together
Lovers devoted
To each other forever
Now I've got things to do
And I've said before
That I know you have too
When I'm not there
In spirit I'll be there
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue
In situations like these
Understand me
Understand me
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue
In situations like these Alle warten auf das Licht
Fürchtet euch fürchtet euch nicht
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Augen
Sie wird heut Nacht nicht untergehen
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn
Hier kommt die Sonne
Hier kommt die Sonne
Sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Hier kommt die Sonne
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Händen
Kann verbrennen kann euch blenden
Wenn sie aus den Fäusten bricht
Legt sich heiss auf das Gesicht
Sie wird heut Nacht nicht untergehen
Und die welt Zählt laut bis zehn
Hier kommt die Sonne
Hier kommmt die Sonne
Sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Hier kommt die Sonne
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Händen
Kann verbrennen kann euch blenden
Wenn sie aus den Fäusten bricht
Legt sich heiss auf dein Gesicht
Legt sich schmerzend auf die Brust
Das Gleichgewicht wird zum Verlust
Lässt dich hart zu Boden gehen
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn
Hier kommt die Sonne
Hier kommt die Sonne
Sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Und wird nie vom Himmel fallen You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you'll wanna be high for this
Take it off, you want it off
Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you'll wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this (x4) If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Let the wrong path come to me
One day, I'm hoping that you will remember me
When you'll fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them another day but Thursday
It seems like pain and regret are your best friends
Cause everything you do leads to them why ?
Run, run
But baby, I could be your best friend
And baby I could fuck you right
Baby you could have it all
Baby you could have it all
Baby you could have the cars
The clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby you could be a star
Blaming all your sins on your best friends
And nothing's ever ever your fault
Nothing's your fault baby, no
Baby you don't need your best friends
Cause I got everything you want
Baby you could have it all
Baby you could have it all
Baby you could have the cars
The clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby you could be a star
If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Let the wrong path come to me
One day, I'm hoping that you will remember me
When you'll fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them another day but Thursday
You belong to me
Every Thursday
I wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist
Only on Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday...
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday...
I love the guitars A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born
Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son to son
And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground
That's been won
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son to son
Won't you hear us sing
Our family song ?
Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear
From father to son
Funny you don't hear
A single word that I say
But my letter to you
Will stay by your side
Thru' the years
Till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will
But the air you breathe
I live to give you
Father to son father to son
Father to son father to son
Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son
Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son Death On Two Legs
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules
With your narrow minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart of your own
Kill joy bad guy big talking small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me ?
Can you face me ?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good are you satisfied ?
Do you feel like suicide ?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night ?
Do you feel good? feel good ?
You talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is
Mister know-all
Was the fin on your back
Part of the deal ? (Shark)
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own
(Right from the start)
Insane you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good I feel good If you say this is pop, to be singing to a tune with a rhythm like this,would it be so unpopular for a singer like me to be bringing up the fact that we're all gonna go?Some people swear, they say they know where.For me it's a mystery. But which ever way you see it
You have to admit it and live it and live it!
We all kick the bucket in the end! The end!All the girls kick the bucket in the end! The end!And the boys kick the bucket in the end! The end!Yep! We all kick the bucket in the end! The end! The end! The end! The end!
Blew up my TV. It' was numbing my brain to be thinking the same as million other people all feeling afraid of the same thing.But there's nothing to lose, 'cause we're all on a bike and we're cycling through,getting off on our injuries - but you gotta get back on it and live it and live it to love it and live and love life.
Cause we all kick the bucket in the end! The end!All the girls kick the bucket in the end! The end!And the boys kick the bucket in the end! My friend!Yep! We all kick the bucket in the end! The end! The end! The end! The end!
This is not a sad song!I don't bring it up to get you down,It's a celebration for all the red cells
Going round and round in your body!
I don't mean to preach or to sound like a teacher.No! I only wanna cut the crap and looking back, everybody's had to face the facts.
That we all kick the bucket in the end! The end!All the girls kick the bucket in the end! The end!And the boys kick the bucket in the end! My friend!Yep! We all kick the bucket in the end! The end! The end! The end! The end! Ich Will 
Ich will dass ihr mir vertraut
Ich will dass ihr mir glaubt
Ich will eure Blicke spüren
Jeden Herzschlag kontrollieren
Ich will eure Stimmen hören
Ich will die Ruhe stören
Ich will dass ihr mich gut seht
Ich will dass ihr mich versteht
Ich will eure Phantasie
Ich will eure Energie
Ich will eure Hände sehen
In Beifall untergehen
Seht ihr mich ?
Versteht ihr mich ?
Fühlt ihr mich ?
Hört ihr mich ?
Könnt ihr mich hören
Könnt ihr mich sehen
Könnt ihr mich fühlen
Ich verstehe euch nicht
Wir wollen dass ihr uns vertraut
Wir wollen dass ihr uns alles glaubt
Wir wollen eure Hände sehen
Wir wollen in Beifall untergehen
Könnt ihr mich hören
Könnt ihr mich sehen
Könnt ihr mich fühlen
Ich verstehe euch nicht
Könnt ihr uns hören
Könnt ihr uns sehen
Könnt ihr uns fühlen
Wir verstehen euch nicht I just want to take you there
He don't gotta know where
Does he touch you here like this ?
Let me take the friction from your lips
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need
I got everything you want with me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby, leave them high heel shoes
Cause I love it when you're lookin' down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock your boots off
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need Do you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesn't come
This twisted, tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Who's longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do
When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
Is there something you need from me
Are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
Your holy one
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun Faith can have strange effects
Money can have strange effects
I ask myself
Is it a sin
To be flexible
When the boat comes in
Open the window and let go out my tears
Things can alter you
Girls can have strange effects too
I ask myself
Is it a sin
To be flexible
When the boat comes in
Open the window and let go out my tears
We all know boats don't last
We all know because of us
I ask myself
Is it a sin
To be flexible
When the boat comes in
Open the window and let go out my tears White Queen (as It Began) 
So sad her eyes smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes as it began
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did sway
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair
Heeding unheard pleading one word
So sad my eyes she cannot see
How did thee fare what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait
So dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends as it began The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were of distinction
A real big spender
Good looking so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind
Let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every girl I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me Getadelt wird wer Schmerzen kennt
Vom Feuer das die Haut verbrennt
Ich werf ein Licht
In mein Gesicht
Ein heisser Schrei
Feuer frei !
Geadelt ist wer Schmerzen kennt
Vom Feuer das in Lust verbrennt
Ein Funkenstoß
In ihren Schoss
Ein heisser Schrei
Feuer frei !
Gefährlich ist wer Schmerzen kennt
Vom Feuer das den Geist verbrennt
Gefährlich das gebrannte Kind
Mit Feuer das vom Leben trennt
Ein heisser Schrei
Feuer frei !
Dein Glück
Ist nicht mein Glück
Ist mein Unglück Been on another level
Since you came
No more pain
Look into my eyes
You can't recognize my face
You're my beloved
You can stay
You can stay
But you belong to me
You belong to me
If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go
This is a happy house
We're happy here
In a happy house
Oh this is fun
Music got you lost
Nights ends so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you aren't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
Baby it's okay and my niggas next door
They be working in the trap
So get louder if you want
Just don't blame it on me
That you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me girl
Cause you wanted to have fun
If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh your mind
Wants to leave
What you came for?
This is a happy house
We're happy here
In a happy house
Oh this is fun
Fun for me
Bring the seven o seven now
Two puffs for the ladies who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Now watch us chase it
With a handful of pills
No chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in her head band
Escaping, her van is wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
Got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo"I heard he do drugs now"You heard wrong I been on them for a minute
We just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' living
And when we act a fool
It's probably cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal
Ain't no fucking phony
Big O know the deal
He the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat
Like he fucking told me
Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"I cut down on her man
Be her fucking story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man
Get to know me
Ain't no offense though
I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone so gone
Bring out the glass tables
With the seven o seven now I go out to work on Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday Afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night
(There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon Darling, I hate to see you so angry with the world
If people want a piece of you
Then they're missing something for themselves.
Maybe it's selfish of me to look at you an say
"Come back to me girl I love and I'll stay"
Cause I love your smile
Yes I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know.
Sometimes I might seem cold holding nack my sympathies
For people stories people tell
Can so easily be believed ;
The truth gets so distorted when everyone knows best
And sadness tends to find his friends
On the road to righteousness -
Darling, let's never be a part of that
Cause I love your smile
Yes I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know.
I don't know why a laugh is hard to find
Could it be all of your fears that we hide behind ?
Like bricks in the wall I wanna see them fall down !
Cause I love your smile
Yes I love your smile
How I love your smile
More than you know. I love her today
Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late
Now I need to know
If you're feeling when I'm free
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday... Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty
Ooh on Thursday, baby get ready on Thursday
Why you calling ? Oh Thursday, just wait on Thursday, baby only Thursday
Girl I try, girl I try
I've been here for too long
Baby don't cry
Why are you calling again ?
But it's not Thursday, baby why you calling ?
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday... Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty
Ooh on Thursday, baby get ready on Thursday
Hold it on Thursday, just wait on Thursday, baby only Thursday
Thursday
Thursday
Thursday
Thursday From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kickin' like they 6 months pregnant
Drinkin' Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn, quarter to seven
The sky's getting cold, we flyin' from the North
We're rockin' with our city like a sold-out show
House full of pros that specialize in the hoe'ing
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split-life livin'
Let the world listen, if a hater's caught slippin'
Then my niggas stay tight, got my back like Pippen
Fast life grippin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic, get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be foldin'
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Push it through the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame

Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know ?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth

She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah I understand, your body wants it
I know your thoughts, oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl and it's your world
And I'mma let you do it how you wanna
Girl now ride with it, ride with it
I know you know, I know you wanna (fuck) with it
Don't be shy with it, I'll supply with it
I got you girl, oh I got it girl
With your Louie V. bag, tats on your arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me
You always come to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the parties
On your knees
I will not beg you please
Girl, pick up them shoes, I'll race your ass up on them stairs
Just grab a room I swear no one will interfere
Girl, bring your friends if you want we can share
Or we can keep it simple baby, we can just
Ride with it, ride with it
I know you know, I know you wanna *snif* with it
Don't be shy with it, I'll supply with it
I got you girl, oh I got it girl
With your Louie V. bag, tats on your arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me
You always come to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the parties
On your knees
I would not let you be
I would not
Ride with it, ride with it
I know you know, I know you wanna line with it
Don't be shy with it, I'll supply with it
I got you girl, oh I got it girl
I know you wanna line with it, line with it
I know you know, I know you wanna...
I got you girl, oh I got you girl
And...
Oh I got it girl
I think I'm fuckin' gone
Rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet
I'll get on it after four
More, sessions of the strong upon your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' roll
But I fuckin' pulled
Feelin' like a billion bucks before
I walked through the store
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your lovin'
I need more
I need yours
She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on ?
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sippin' on this, baby livin' off bliss
Got me drownin' in your love
Got me drownin' in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drownin' from my wrist
Baby if you knew
The feelin' I would give to you
You...
Cause I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me
You...
Oh I got it girl
With me
I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops then I might get violent
No call is worth stoppin'
So momma please stop callin'
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fuckin' prove
This feelin' I would give to you
You...
Oh I got it girl
Yeah I got it girl
With me I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
And maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling
But if we'd only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start
Every now and then life says
Where do you think you're going so fast
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind
And if we'd get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills on the horizon
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say...
A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
And we'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills Suche gut gebauten 18 bis 30 Jährigen

- Der Metzgemeister
Heute treff ich einen Herrn
Der hat mich zum Fressen gern
Weiche Teile und auch harte
Stehen auf der Speisekarte
[Refrain]
Denn du bist, was du isst
Und ihr wisst, was es ist
Es ist mein Teil - (nein)
Mein teil - (nein)
Da - das ist mein Teil - (nein)
Mein Teil - (nein)
Die stumpfe Klinge gut und recht
Ich blute stark und mir ist schlecht
Muss ich auch mit der Ohnmacht kämpfen
Ich esse weiter unter Krämpfen
Ist doch so gut gewürzt und so schön flambiert
Und so liebevoll auf Porzellan serviert
Dazu ein guter Wein und zarter Kerzenschein
Ja da lass ich mir zeit, etwas Kultur muss sein
[Refrain]
Ein Schrei wird zum Himmel fahren
Schneidet sich durch Engelsscharen
Vom Wolkendach fällt Federfleisch
Auf meine Kindheit mit gekreisch
Das ist mein Teil - (nein)
Mein Teil - (nein)
Da - das ist mein Teil - (nein)
Yes it's mein Teil - (nein) Roots
Don’t throw stones at me
Don’t tell anybody
Woah, woah, woah
Trouble finds me, woah
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief
Woah, woah, woah
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Had to lose my way
To know which road to take
Woah, woah, woah
Trouble finds me, woah
All I look forward
Washed away by a wave
Woah, woah, woah
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
I know it’s gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I know it’s gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
Chorus:
I'm only up when your not down
Don't wanna fly if your'e still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Quand je suis avec quelqu'un d'autre, c'est si difficile d'être moi-même
And only you can tell...Et seulement toi remarque...
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell...
Chorus:
That I'm only up when your'e not down
Don't wanna fly if your'e still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah Out in the vast
Where time is standing still
I have been looking for sanctuary
Left the world behind
To find some peace of mind
Now I am one with eternity
Millenniums are passing
In the blink of an eye
While I was searching my very soul
Longing for the answer
To the question of it all
Is it man or machine in control?
Far beyond on cosmic winds
I have been meeting my fate
Now I see
That the answer's been in me
I am the Savior
The chosen one
I am the ultimate dream
I am man and machine
I am the Savior
The only one
And from eternity
I will return
Time has come
Time has come
Used to be a traveler
On a never-ending ride
Touching the end of the Universe
Never to rest
Always on the quest
For deliverance from the eternal curse
Far beyond on cosmic winds
I saw the truth to it all
Now I see
What the future holds for me
I am the Savior
The chosen one
I am the ultimate dream
I am man and machine
I am the Savior
The only one
And from eternity
I will return
Time has come
Time has come Ah, ah, mm, you be good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
I could tell the world
A thing or two about love
I know little girl only a fool
Would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Thank you girl for lovin' me
The way that you do (way that you do)
That's the kind of love that
Is too good to be true
Al all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Ah, ah, mm, you be good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Aôh, Aôh, Aôh. It breaks my heart
To leave you far behind
It breaks me up
To leave so suddenly
Knowing we might never
Meet again
It hurts so much
To lose another friend
I could hope you're just as sad
To see me go
But I'd hate to be the cause
Of grief to someone I like so
Knowing we might never
Meet again
It hurts so much
To lose another friend. I wanna hypnotise you so
Let your inhibitions go
Make every touch electrical
When you're feeling beautiful
Will you remember me ?
I want to touch your deep inside
And find the secrets that you hide
When your fears are cast aside
Will you remember me ?
Easily forgotten love
Easily forgotten love
It's not so easily
I just want to let you know
My mind refuses to let you go
I wanna hypnotise you so
You will remember me
Easily forgotten love
Easily forgotten love
It's not so easily
Easily forgotten love
Easily forgotten love
Easily the best I ever had
Easily the best I ever had Get your party gown and get your pigtail down

All your love tonight You only live twice or so they say,
One life for yourself, one for the rest.
You drift through the years and life seems strange,
And one dream appears, love is its name.
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.
You only live twice or so it seems,
One life for yourself, one your dreams.
And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone. Not today
There she goes, in front of me
Take my life, and set me free again
We'll make memory out of it
Holy road, is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make memory out of it
We finally fall apart
We break each others heart's
If we wanna live young love
 We better start today
It's gonna get
Easier oh, easier, somehow
Oh cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh easier, and easier, somehow
Oh I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over, unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that

Easier and easier, somehow
But not today, not today
There she goes, in front of me
Take my life, and set me free again
We'll make memory out of it
Holy road, is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make memory out of it
We finally fall apart
We break each others heart's
If we wanna live young love

Not today, not today
Not today, not today New Born
(Chorus 1:)Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Strech it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the newborn
When you've seen, seen
Too much too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are your worth
You can't come down to earth
You're swelling up - you're unstoppable
'Cause you've seen, seen
Too much too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
(Chorus 2:)Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
(Chorus 1)

Deutschland She can't see the way your eyes light up
When you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
Chorus:
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
You just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
There's a fire inside of you that can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
(Chorus)
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh we're invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes and make you realize
I just wanna show you she don't even know you
Baby let me love you let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
She can't see the way your eyes light up
When you smile Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand. (x3)
Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand. (x3)

Dreaming about your heart again

(It’s your heart again)
Despair was on your mind

You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain
(Your heart again)

So I will close my ears to the falling with the crowd
I never thought of her
I listen to your air
Try to shout and I will smile
You can hear, hear your infectious laugh
But you can’t hear me ring the bell
You can hear, hear you singing along to this
And pretending not to hear me shout
Too many heard
So I will close my ears to the falling with the crowd
I never thought of her
I listen to your air
Try to shout and I will smile
I never thought of her
(Falling with the crowd)Here’s to my mistake - Falling with the crowd -I wanna go home
Dressed by no one else
Doesn’t matter cause I’m not that sure
To aware of what's been done before
You can hear, hear you singing along to this
And pretending not to hear me shout
You know it's true
So I will close my earsto the falling with the crowd
I never thought of her
I listen to your air
Try to shout and I will smile
I never thought of her
(Falling with the crowd)Dressed my breath to live - Falling with the crowd -
I wanna go home
Dressed by no one else
Drilled into my cave [First Verse]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream
Please don't wake me
No don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need
