Then Noam was a good host. We ordered some pizza, played some video games. And watched some movie. And today after hopelessly looking for the key everywhere - then had to go looking for the landlord. paid 200Euro.. man I feel bad."

Probably have to go through 100 rejections before I see something. So I was kind of depressed the whole day today. Fear, inadequacy and insecurity kicked in together. I am planning to this tech conference in town, the NConf. It is happening on the 19th of Oct."

She told me all about life and what it was like growing up as a kid in a big family. She bought me some ice cream. Her birthday is coming on the 15th of November. I will have to buy her a gift. I am thinking of a nice scarf. She loves scarfs."

I had to go today to the student office to get all my certificates. My final cummulative grade wasn't as bad as I thought actually. I am also planning to fly for vacation one day before the eve of new year."
